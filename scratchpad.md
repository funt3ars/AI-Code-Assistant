# Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks
- When implementing async context managers in Python, ensure proper cleanup in **aexit** to prevent resource leaks
- Use exponential backoff for retry mechanisms to prevent overwhelming servers during temporary failures
- Implement token bucket algorithm for rate limiting to ensure smooth request distribution
- Configure logging with both file and console handlers for better debugging and monitoring
- Use type hints and docstrings consistently to improve code maintainability and IDE support
- When implementing HTML parsers, handle malformed HTML gracefully with try-except blocks
- Normalize URLs consistently by handling relative paths and different URL formats
- Remove script and style elements before extracting text content to avoid noise
- Use BeautifulSoup's built-in methods for text extraction to handle whitespace properly
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for parser failures
- When creating mock servers, implement various test scenarios (errors, slow responses, malformed content)
- Use pytest fixtures for managing test resources (servers, clients, etc.)
- Implement comprehensive test coverage for both success and failure cases
- Use async/await patterns consistently in test code
- Measure and verify rate limiting behavior in tests
- Test concurrent operations to ensure thread safety
- Use logging in tests to help with debugging
- Normalize test data and expected results for consistency

# Scratchpad

# Concurrent Web Scraper Implementation Plan

## Task Description

Implement a concurrent web scraper that can extract and analyze data from multiple websites simultaneously, handling different types of content and providing structured output.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Concurrency Management

   - Handling multiple simultaneous requests
   - Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target sites
   - Managing connection pools efficiently

2. Content Extraction

   - Different HTML structures across sites
   - Handling dynamic content (JavaScript)
   - Extracting various content types (text, images, links)

3. Data Storage

   - Structured storage for different content types
   - Efficient indexing and querying
   - Data deduplication

4. Analysis Capabilities
   - Text analysis and summarization
   - Image processing and classification
   - Link analysis and network mapping

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Scraping Infrastructure

1. Set up async HTTP client with connection pooling
2. Implement rate limiting and retry mechanisms
3. Create base HTML parser with error handling
4. Develop content type detection system

### Phase 2: Content Extraction

1. Implement text extraction with HTML cleaning
2. Add image download and processing
3. Develop link extraction and validation
4. Create content type-specific parsers

### Phase 3: Data Storage

1. Design database schema for different content types
2. Implement data deduplication
3. Create indexing system for efficient querying
4. Add data export capabilities

### Phase 4: Analysis Features

1. Implement text analysis (sentiment, keywords)
2. Add image analysis (classification, metadata)
3. Develop link analysis (network mapping)
4. Create visualization tools

## Success Criteria

- Successfully scrape 100+ pages concurrently
- Extract and store all content types correctly
- Process and analyze data within acceptable time limits
- Maintain 99.9% uptime during scraping
- Handle errors gracefully without crashing

## Dependencies

- aiohttp for async HTTP requests
- BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing
- SQLAlchemy for database operations
- NLTK for text analysis
- Pillow for image processing
- NetworkX for link analysis
